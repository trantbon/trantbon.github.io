                    <i>My own quote: "I write my legacy in sweat and ink—one stride, one study, one dream at a time."</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>I am a highly driven and versatile individual, excelling in both academics and athletics. With a track record of excellence,
                    I've earned numerous trophies, medals, and awards that speak to my dedication across disciplines. As an all-rounder, I take pride in balancing
                    rigorous academic pursuits with elite-level performance on the field. Among the many sports I compete in, soccer stands out
                    as a passion and a strength—one in which I've consistently dominated, collecting a wealth of accolades and team triumphs along the way.
                    My journey is fueled by discipline, passion, and an unrelenting pursuit of excellence.

                    <br><br>
                    My success in academics and sport is fueled not just by talent, but by the habits I’ve built beyond them. Chess sharpens
                    my strategic thinking and quick decision-making, while swimming strengthens my physical endurance. These aren't just 
                    hobbies—they're integral to how I train, think, and perform. I rely on a strict daily routine to maintain that edge,
                     because when I slip, fatigue takes over. Discipline isn’t optional—it’s my foundation.

                    <br><br>
                    Over time, I’ve discovered a deep passion not only for sports 🏀🏊 but also for creative writing ✍️. I love letting
                    my imagination run wild—crafting stories and exploring ideas without the fear of being judged for how “crazy” or 
                    out-of-the-box they might be 🚀. Writing gives me the freedom to express myself in ways that feel truly authentic.
                    <br><br>
                    Lately, I’ve also found myself developing a growing appreciation for mathematics ➕➗. It's like a fascinating
                     puzzle that challenges and excites me with every problem I solve. Recently, I’ve been putting a lot of effort
                      into preparing for a major academic milestone—the Selective School Test (or SS for short) 🎯📚. It’s a big
                       challenge, but I’m feeling more motivated than ever to give it my best!</p>
