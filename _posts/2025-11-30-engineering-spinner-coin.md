This is continuing from my first CrunchLabs box. This next box comes with the coin spinner, which is actually way cooler than it sounds. Most people around the world can’t even spin a coin properly — like, it just wobbles around and dies instantly. That’s literally why Mark Rober made the coin spinner in the first place. It helps you spin a coin perfectly every single time, even if you’re terrible at spinning coins normally.

And the funny thing is, it’s not even some high-tech invention. It’s literally just a few bits of wood, some elastic bands, and a couple of coins. That’s it. But when you put it all together, it turns into this super satisfying little gadget that teaches you about balance, energy, and physics without you even noticing you’re learning anything.

The key thing in this whole contraption is the ratchet. We actually see ratchets everywhere in our daily lives — in seat belts, clocks and watches, bikes, and heaps of other places you don’t even think about. The ratchet’s main job is simple: it lets something move in one direction, but not the other. It’s like a one-way door for motion.

In the coin spinner, the ratchet is what lets you choose exactly how much power you want to load up before you launch the coin. You can crank it up little by little, and it locks into place so it doesn’t snap back. Then when you release it, all that stored energy gets dumped into the coin and it spins like crazy. That’s the whole magic behind it — super simple parts, but really clever engineering.
