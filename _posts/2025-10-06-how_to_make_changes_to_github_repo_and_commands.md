**Making Changes to GitHub Repo**

To make changes to a GitHub repo, you start by opening your terminal. This is the place where you type commands. Make sure you're inside the folder of the project you want to work on. Once you're there, you can open the files and make any changes you want‚Äîlike fixing bugs, adding new features, or updating text. After you're done editing, go back to the terminal and type *(git add .)* to tell Git that you want to include all the changes you just made. Then type git *(commit -m "your message")*‚Äîinside the quotes, write a short note about what you changed, like "fixed login bug" or "updated homepage text." This saves your changes with a label so you can remember what you did. Finally, type *(git push)* to send your changes up to GitHub so they show up in the online repo. That‚Äôs it! Your updates are now live on GitHub.

**Merging and Creating New Branches**
Branching in Git is like making a sandbox where you can play with new ideas without messing up your main project. It‚Äôs super useful for testing features or fixing bugs safely. To create a new branch, use *(git switch -c ______)*, which makes and switches to the branch in one go. Make sure you add the name of the branch in the blank space. After making changes, you can merge it back into the main branch **(usually called master)* by first switching back with git switch master, then running git merge feature-idea. This pulls in all your updates. Everything stays tracked inside your Git repo, so you always know what‚Äôs changed and where.
