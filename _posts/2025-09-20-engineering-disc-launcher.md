This is the start of a series of my life to got to my dream job, an engineer. I will be posting after I finish one blog about my day to day life and what I do to become an engineer. In here is information about what I have learned about the robot that I had to build, the disc launcher.

Today, I received my first ever CrunchLabs box made Mark Rober. Each month, Mark sends out a new box with parts that you use to build with a video explaining the physics and how to build the robot. Since I just started, I got the easiest build challenge which was a disc launcher. There was many parts used to build it, but the most important part was the flywheel. It is a hollow, heavy wheel that spins and stores up kinetic energy but spinning at very high rates.
