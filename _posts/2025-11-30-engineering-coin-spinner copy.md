This is continuing from my first CrunchLabs box. This next box comes with the coin spinner, which is actually way cooler than it sounds. Most people around the world can’t even spin a coin properly — like, it just wobbles and falls over. That’s why Mark Rober made the coin spinner in the first place. It helps you spin a coin perfectly every time.

And the funny thing is, it’s not even some high-tech invention. It’s literally just a few bits of wood, some elastic bands, and a couple of coins. That’s it. But when you put it all together, it becomes this super satisfying little gadget that teaches you about balance and physics without you even realizing it.

The key thing in this contraption is the ratchet. We see the ratchet everywhere in our daily lives, like seat belts, clocks and watches, bicycles and many more places.
The ratchet's core function is to allow motion to move in one way, but not the other way.
