This is the one of many logs of the series of my life to get to my dream job, an engineer. I will be posting after I finish one blog about my day to day life and what I do to become an engineer. In here is information about what I have learned about the robot that I had to build, the disc launcher.

Today, I finished a long-lost robot that I started a few months ago. It’s a hydraulic excavator — a machine powered not by electricity or motors, but by water. As the name suggests, “hydraulic” means it runs using fluid pressure, and in this case, water becomes the driving force behind every movement.

Instead of wires, circuits and batteries, this robot relies on syringes and tubes filled with water. The heart of the system is the hydropump. When I push or pull the control piston, water flows through the tubes and activates other pistons attached to the robot’s joints. This pressure causes the arms to lift, lower, and scoop — just like a real excavator on a construction site. It’s incredible how something as simple as water can be used to move heavy parts with such precision and strength.

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how hydraulic systems work in real-world machines like diggers, cranes, and even aircraft landing gear. These systems use fluid to transfer force efficiently, allowing for smooth and powerful motion. It’s a brilliant example of physics in action — pressure, force, and mechanical advantage all working together.
But the journey wasn’t just about building a robot. I learned so much along the way. From building the design and assembling the frame to troubleshooting problems and fine-tuning the movement, every step taught me something new. I explored the physics behind each part — how pistons work, how pressure builds, and how mechanical systems convert energy into motion. I also discovered the importance of precision and patience, especially when working with fluid-based systems
