This is the one of many logs of the series of my life to get to my dream job, an engineer. I will be posting after I finish one blog about my day to day life and what I do to become an engineer. In here is information about what I have learned about the robot that I had to build, the disc launcher.

Today, I finished a long lost robot that I started a few months ago. It is a hydraulic excavator. As the name suggests, it is an excavator that runs using water — as in hydro. Instead of using electricity or motors to move, this robot uses water pressure to control its arms and bucket. The main part that makes this possible is the hydropump. When I push or pull the syringes connected to tubes filled with water, the pressure moves through the tubes and pushes other syringes on the robot. That pressure makes the arms lift, lower, or scoop — just like a real excavator. It’s amazing how something as simple as water can be used to move heavy parts. This helped me understand how hydraulic systems work in real machines like diggers, cranes, and even airplanes. It’s all about using fluid to transfer force and make things move smoothly and powerfully.
