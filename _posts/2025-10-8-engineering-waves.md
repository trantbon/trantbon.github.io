Waves are like invisible wiggles that carry energy from one place to another. They don’t move stuff like people or chairs, but they do move energy through things like air, water, or even space. There are two main types of waves: mechanical waves and electromagnetic waves. Mechanical waves need something to travel through, like air or water. Electromagnetic waves, like light, can travel through empty space — even where there’s nothing at all!

Mechanical waves come in two styles: transverse and longitudinal. Transverse waves go up and down, like ocean waves or when you shake a rope. Longitudinal waves squish and stretch, like sound waves moving through air. Waves have cool parts like crests (the top), troughs (the bottom), and amplitude (how tall the wave is). They also have wavelength (how long they are) and frequency (how fast they wiggle). These parts help scientists figure out how strong or fast a wave is.

Waves are super useful. Sound waves help us hear, and light waves help us see. They’re also used in phones, radios, and even art! Waves can bounce off things (that’s called reflection), and they can change speed depending on what they’re moving through. For example, sound travels faster in water than in air because water is thicker. Our ears are amazing — they catch sound waves and turn them into signals our brain understands. Waves might seem invisible, but they’re everywhere and they make life way more awesome!
