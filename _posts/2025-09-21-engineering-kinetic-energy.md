Kinetic energy is the energy an object has because it’s moving. The faster something moves, and the heavier it is, the more kinetic energy it has. For example, a rolling ball, a flying bird, or a speeding car all have kinetic energy. Engineers use this concept to design machines that move, like vehicles, robots, or even amusement park rides. Understanding kinetic energy helps us figure out how motion works and how to control it to do useful things — like lifting, launching, or stopping objects.

While learning about kinetic energy, I was also introduced to potential energy. Potential energy refers to the energy stored in a system due to the position or configuration of two or more interacting objects. These interactions can be gravitational, electric, or magnetic. For example, any two masses within a gravitational field have gravitational potential energy, often represented as U_g. This energy depends on their masses and the distance between them.

Electric potential energy arises when objects with electric charge interact through an electric field(U_m). These charges can be negative (−) or positive (+). Opposite charges attract each other, while like charges—such as two negative particles—repel each other. 

Lastly, magnetic potential energy involves objects with magnetic fields, known as magnets. Unlike electric charges, magnets have poles: north and south. Magnetic interactions are similar to electric ones—opposite poles attract, and like poles repel. Magnetic potential energy is influenced by the force between these poles, often represented as F_m.
