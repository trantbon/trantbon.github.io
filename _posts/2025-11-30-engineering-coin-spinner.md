Most people around the world can’t even spin a coin properly — like, it just wobbles and falls over. That’s why Mark Rober made the coin spinner in the first place. It helps you spin a coin perfectly every time.

But when you put it all together, it becomes this super satisfying little gadget that teaches you about balance and physics without you even realizing it.

The key thing in this contraption is the ratchet. We see the ratchet everywhere in our daily lives, like seat belts, clocks and watches, bicycles and many more places.
