Today, I received my first ever CrunchLabs box made Mark Rober. Each month, Mark sends out a new box with parts that you use to build with a video explaining the physics and how to build the robot. Since I just started, I got the easiest build challange which was a disc launcher. There was many parts used to build it, but the most important part was the flywheel. It is a hollow, heavy wheel that spins and stores up kinetic energy but sinning at very high rates.
