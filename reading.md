Their race to contain the object's deadly power reveals a deeper conspiracy and proves that Lucy’s psychic connection to the dead is growing dangerously strong.*

At the end of the story, even though they stop the ghosts, Lucy decides to leave the team because she is scared her powers will accidentally get Lockwood, the boy she has a crush on, killed. *
